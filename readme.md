This project is developed to perform REST API, and backend services.
I've used an Express generator, and router for the diffrent routes.
I've used MongoDB as database and Mongoose for schemas.
Using all three, GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations can be performed once the server is up.
I've added basic cookie-based authentication initially, then I upgraded it with session-based auth, and currently it's passport-based auth.
